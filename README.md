# BERT-Semantic-Similarity-Flask-App

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model that can be used to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks, including semantic similarity. Semantic similarity refers to the degree to which two sentences or phrases have similar meanings.

In the context of BERT, semantic similarity is typically measured using a technique called sentence-pair classification. This involves training BERT on a dataset of sentence pairs, where each pair consists of two sentences and a label indicating whether the sentences are semantically similar or not. Once trained, BERT can be used to predict the semantic similarity between any two sentences by classifying them as similar or not.

To use BERT for semantic similarity, the two sentences are passed through the model, which generates a fixed-length representation for each sentence. These representations are then compared using a similarity metric, such as cosine similarity, to determine the degree of semantic similarity between the two sentences.

The BERT model can also be fine-tuned with specific datasets to improve its performance on certain tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.

BERT has been shown to be highly effective in capturing the semantic similarity between sentence pairs and it's widely used in many NLP tasks, due to its ability to understand the meaning of the text and its context, which allows it to generate more accurate and meaningful semantic representations.
